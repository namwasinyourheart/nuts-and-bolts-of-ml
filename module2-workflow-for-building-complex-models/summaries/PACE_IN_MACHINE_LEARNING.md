# PACE in Machine Learning

This lecture focuses on the PACE workflow for building effective models. PACE stands for **Plan**, **Analyze**, **Construct**, and **Execute**. It provides a structured approach to aligning data and models with business needs, ensuring a systematic and efficient model-building process.

## **The Four Stages of PACE**

### **1. Plan**
In the planning stage, the business problem and data are clearly defined. Itâ€™s important to understand the objectives, such as predicting customer churn, and determine the necessary resources and metrics for success.

### **2. Analyze**
The analysis stage involves a deep examination of the data, including assessing its quality, structure, and relevance. Data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identifying patterns or relationships are key to preparing the data for modeling. Feature engineering and techniques to manage class imbalances are also applied.

### **3. Construct**
During construction, the appropriate modeling techniques and algorithms are selected. In this case, a supervised learning model, **Naive Bayes**, is used to predict bank customer churn. The model is trained on historical data to identify patterns that contribute to customer churn.

### **4. Execute**
The execution stage involves deploying the model and evaluating its performance. The model is tested on new data to assess its effectiveness, using performance metrics to determine how well it addresses the business problem. This phase helps ensure that the model provides valuable insights and meets expectations.

## **Example: Bank Customer Churn Prediction**
The goal in this case is to predict whether a customer will close their bank account, a process known as **customer churn**. Churn rate measures the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Multiple iterations of the model are created to improve predictions continuously.

Using the PACE workflow ensures that data-driven problems are approached systematically, helping to achieve business goals through effective modeling.
